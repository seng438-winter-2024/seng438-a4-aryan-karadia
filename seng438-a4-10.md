# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
## Killed mutants:

1. **getCentralValue()**: I found that substituting 2.0 with -1.0 changes the calculation of the central value, which was caught by my tests checking this method.
2. **intersects()**: I noticed that removing a conditional or negating a return statement alters the logic of intersection, which was detected by my tests for this method.
3. **constrain()**: I observed that changing the `!contains(value)` check to a less than or equal check modifies the constraint logic, which was caught by my tests checking the constraints.
4. **combine()**: I discovered that removing the null check for `range1` could lead to a NullPointerException, which was caught by my tests checking the combination of ranges.
5. **combineIgnoringNaN()**: I identified that removing the call to `java/lang/Double::isNaN` changes the logic of the combination operation, which was caught by my tests checking this method.

## Surviving mutants:

1. **getLength()**: I found that negating the `lower` field or replacing subtraction with addition changes the length calculation, which seems to have slipped through my tests.
2. **intersects()**: I noticed that changing the `(b0 <= this.lower)` conditional boundary alters the intersection logic, which seems to have not been covered by my tests.
3. **constrain()**: I observed that changing the inequality checks could modify the constraint logic, which seems to have not been covered by my tests.
4. **shift()**: I discovered that negating the conditional at line 4 changes the logic of the shift operation, which seems to have not been covered by my tests.
5. **equals()**: I identified that changing the equality check to less than or equal at line 7 alters the equality logic, which seems to have not been covered by my tests.
